# BOGAZICI UNIVERSITY CMPE 48A CLOUD COMPUTING PROJECT
### Blockchain Network that works on Google Cloud Platform Virtual Machines

First of all there are two main source while I am implementing this project. 

[Back-End and Front-End Implementation of Blockchain](https://medium.com/@MKGOfficial/build-a-simple-blockchain-cryptocurrency-with-python-django-web-framework-reactjs-f1aebd50b6c)

First, we need to create virtual machine instances on GCP(or other platforms) in order to run the blockchain. Since we deploy Django Project, we need to launch
Django Stack deployment tool while creating vm to easily run the project.
